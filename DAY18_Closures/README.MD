# What is a Closure?

## Let’s look at the definition of a closure:

Closure is created when an inner function has access to its outer function variables and arguments. The inner function has access to –

2. Outer function's variables and arguments.
3. Global variables

Closure is when a function is able to access its lexical scope, even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

Inner functions can access its parent scope, even after the parent function is already executed
